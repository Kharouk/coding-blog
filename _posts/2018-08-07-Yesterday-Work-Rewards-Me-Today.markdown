I’ve been coding now for almost three months. Small change, little steps, I know. However this week marks the next step of my life as a software developer. I was accepted into a bootcamp in London, [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I’ve begun the pre-course work yesterday and am already making tidal waves of movement in my learning.

There are many posts about life as a web developer, or one’s process of getting that first job. I’ll be submitting this into the category of “a developer’s journey via bootcamp.” I think these are important posts. Bootcamps are expensive. So is your time. But you might want to go to a bootcamp. Maybe specifically Makers. Hopefully I can give you some context of the journey.


### First Two Weeks
I think a common trait that is shared amongst eager learners is ‘rapid passion.’ Passion that builds so fast that you just don’t know what to do with it. Maybe you write a song about it, or you build a project. You need some kind of outlet for all the passion. When I first started to code, I had the case of the rushin’ rapid passion. I created a website with WordPress. Posted constantly about this HTML tag or that CSS attribute. I felt like I was learning enough to talk about it. Which is fine, even if you read it back now and think of how much of a novice you were two months ago.

Then as those first two weeks pass, there’s that **dipping point**. Many don’t make it back. That’s when you realise there’s more to programming than just HTML. There’s JavaScript and other languages. Front-end; Back-end. Full-stack or node stacks with a sprinkle of dated MEAN stacks. Keywords start to emerge, as if bidding you to come with them. Learn this framework or this language. This framework gets the $$$. This language is older than the guy who wrote it!

All these words. They can overwhelm you. And it’s at this point the dipping occurs. The overwhelming world of software development comes at you, like paparazzi after a leaked affair.

During my first two weeks I thought I could do it all. Bought many Udemy courses, believing in those 99.999999% discounts they always claim to offer. Signed up to all the online courses. Even considered to enrol into a remote bootcamp right then and there.  Luckily I took a step back. Since I already purchased the '[Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)' for ten quid, I decided to only play with the thought of attending a real in-person bootcamp once I finish that course.

### First Month Passed, Enter Month Two
So the first two weeks pass and I made it through the dipping point. I’m even making great progress on the Web Developer Bootcamp. However I was going through the JavaScript material and it was tough. Like real tough. The instructor then introduced jQuery and I started feeling that overwhelming pressure of Imposter Syndrome. The whole time I was thinking *man, I have an english degree. Why am I even doing this?*

At this point, I actually took a step back. Not to quit (although I contemplated the thought), but to actually try another language out. Now I doubt this is recommended by the pros, but it worked for me. I decided to try out Python. I even went to a workshop titled Python 101 at General Assembly. Funnily enough it actually helped me grasp the things that confused me the most about JavaScript.

I started to see what Object Oriented Programming actually meant. And why everything is an object. I began to understand context, as well as scope. It felt relieving. Later on, this will allow me to understand Ruby with no issue. Now, whilst I have a better understanding, it’s not the perfect understanding. I don’t have enough experience with OOP, but at least I know the keywords to search for in google whenever I have a question.

So I took a step back from Python (still on hold to this day, but still eager to get into the language), and continued my journey with JavaScript.

### Month Three is Just Around the Corner from Today
So I finished that course with a basic understanding of front-end and back-end. How APIs work and what are libraries and frameworks. Honestly, I’m really thankful for the course. It helped give me a kind of TL;DR of what the Web Development looks like. I didn’t absorb 100% of it, but it left me curious. Which leads me to why I’m writing this.

I never really thought about my future until last week. As I’ve mentioned in a previous post, I was in a rough spot before deciding to make some healthy life-changing choices. It was during this transition I discovered to code. Once I began feeling well-adjusted, with this ‘coding’ thing in my toolbox, I realised: *Wow. I love this. I want this to be the thing I do for the rest of my life.*

I finished the online course curious. I then finished a few other courses, still curious. Then I decided to take the step to join Makers. Because I’m curious. Not only of code, and what languages can do, or what apps I’ll make, but I’m curious about the future. What I will see and do. Who I’ll become.

### #100DaysOfCode
Today marks **Day Six**! I've created some rules since the last big blog update, as well as added some more projects to my GitHub! Although the latter isn't so difficult since once you start a course, the projects start coming.

I've made progress with both personal and Makers projects. Added a [cryptocurrency portfolio app]() that is still currently in development. Run on Rails as its my first time using Rails! Thought I'd kick it off with a fun project.

Also, since I knew I'd be travelling at times within the 100 Day period, I decided to add the rule that if I'm travelling AND there's not way for me to access internet, those days don't count. That may be cheap but hey, it's my first round. Let's just see if I get close to 100 days.

#### What do you think?

Do you agree with all the dipping points and high passion rates? Let me know if you think I'm terribly wrong. Or let me know if you want to mix it up, by reading my previous blogpost about [Ruby Modules and Mixins](https://kharouk.github.io/).

Thanks for reading. Until next time.
