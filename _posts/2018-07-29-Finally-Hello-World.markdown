Wow. So it begins. It took me a while to set this up, being a newbie and all. I always either used already-set blogging websites like Medium or .Wordpress. Then I tried setting up my own blogging site, but with a customisable theme that I could purchase. Now, well. I went beyond that.

I know it's only jekyll, and it's a simpler way of setting up a blog. But the use of gems and the terminal and, in my case, messing with the sudo command and the bundle which ended up in me having to delete directories and my nails being chewed off because I was being an idiot... Anyways. It works. It all works and I'm so proud of it! I can finally join the thousand others default themed jekyll blogsites on github!
