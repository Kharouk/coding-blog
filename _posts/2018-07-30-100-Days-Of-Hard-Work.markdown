### There are a lot of new beginnings in my life. 
Especially in these last six months. I’ve been living in London for two years, in an apartment I wouldn’t necessarily call my home. I know, that’s a shame. It’s also unfair to my partner, whom I’ve been living with for a year now. 

But you know that feeling. That feeling where you just feel hopeless and upset all the time. You feel bored, and procrastination feeds that boredom. You end up doing nothing with your life. The choices you made leading up to this moment were for nothing. 

### I felt like a walking shell of a man. 
And when you’re in a city where you don’t feel like home, and you’re in a body that doesn’t feel like it’s yours, you begin to start cracking. Losing faith becomes your routine.

This isn’t a post about mental health or the like. It’s more of a comparison. Six months ago I started to get my act together. I realised I was tired of rotting at my desk or in my bed. I could do better. My partner thought so too. She believed in me when honestly, I just couldn’t. 

So I said *to hell with it*. I’ll at least try today and see what happens tomorrow. Flash forward to today. To this post. A lot of things changed. 

### A lot of good things happened in these last six months. 

Today I’ve been coding for exactly two months. I started in May when I attended a Digital Marketing course at General Assembly. At that time marketing seemed like the career-changer for me. I’d get to their workspace early, grab myself a mug of free coffee and I’ll just watch all these developers-in-training. They sat in the large common room where all of General Assembly’s students could mingle and talk. And they’d chat about their apps, their websites. How they’d integrate this or use that API. It was awesome to watch. The code on the screen, not necessarily looking hacker-ish, but intense and vivid. *Powerful*, I thought at the time.

It was awesome to watch. The code on the screen, not necessarily looking hacker-ish, but intense and vivid. ***Powerful***, I thought at the time. 

So, the digital marketing did not work out for me. But I left the course with a powerful impression. Not by analytics or campaigns, but by the **power** of code. Too cheesy?

### 100 Days of Code
Although I could’ve started two months earlier (I’d be more than halfway done by now), the [#100days of code](http://www.100daysofcode.com/) was created for those who always wanted to give coding a try. Whether for fun, for satisfying curiosity, or for people like me. Who want a new life. Code every day for at least an hour. Talk about it. Hold yourself accountable. Your tutorials don’t count. Your homework or work don’t count either. It’s all about projects and creation.

I want to be a part of it. So let this post ring out like a gunshot starting a race. I <em>am</em> a part of it. It’s been more than 200 days since I was at my lowest. I’m okay with working above and beyond for the next 100.
