# Rebuilding Facebook - Fluency in Programming- Part II
![Fluency](/assets/fluency.jpeg)

[Last post][1] I discussed the importance of teamwork and my experience working in a team for two weeks. Doing what? Building Facebook from scratch. No *starter code*, no big tutorial covering the beginning, middle, or end. Just the open source tools that developers can use. In my last point, I brought up the three main goals I had when working on this project.

	- I use an agile product development process
	- I can program fluently
	- I can justify the way I work

The first goal was semi-accomplished. I felt that we had the right mindset from the get go, but we lacked in execution towards the end. To summarise that post, teamwork can have its ups and downs but it‚Äôs important to remember that everyone works differently and it‚Äôs vital to communicate.

This post will be more technical. The second goal is all about being confident in saying, in an interview, that `I can program fluently`.  First of all, just thinking about confidently telling an employer that I‚Äôm a fluent programmer feels like I am lying. It‚Äôs easy to just say *no, you‚Äôre not* or a more reasonable  *I‚Äôm still improving*, rather than saying **yes. I am a fluent programmer.** And if it is difficult, then it‚Äôs important to have evidence to prove yourself (and others) otherwise.

When I first considered this goal, I wondered how to gather that evidence. It‚Äôs such an overwhelming phrase, maybe even a bit cocky. But it‚Äôs an important principle in Makers. Teamwork is good, great code is brilliant, but essentially I am at a bootcamp to learn how to program. Therefore, how can I prove that I'm a fluent programmer? Well, building Facebook from scratch could be a good piece of evidence! 

We built Facebook using a few open-source tools. We used a web framework called [Ruby on Rails][2] that none of us really ever used professionally. Sure, we wrote in Ruby before and even used a smaller framework called [Sinatra][3], but nothing to the scale that Rails provided us. We also decided to use the PostgreSQL database rather than the built-in Sqlite. This is due to personal preference and our experience use Postgres before the project. We also incorporated Continuous Integration using [Travis][4], as well as deploying our production build to AWS [Elastic Beanstalk][5]! That was troublesome, and a big struggle for us, however it was rewarding once our application deployed! 

Some other things we used continuously were testing frameworks like [RSpec][6] for unit-testing and [Capybara][7] for e2e/feature-testing. We also used a Linter called [Rubocop][8] to make sure our code was properly formatted and [SimpleCov][9] (with CodeClimate) to make sure our test coverage was high enough to merge into our master branch (our main Github branch for deploying to production). In some parts of our application, we even included React. We had the spare time in our last week to include some React Components, which allowed us to get some Front-End practice with the famous framework. 

That‚Äôs our toolkit. The toolkit that allowed us to remake Facebook. It doesn‚Äôt feel like much, actually. You hear so many frameworks these days and terms regarding Single Page Applications or Static Sites but you realise all you need is to master a web framework like Rails and you can essentially create a web application. But does that make me a fluent programmer? Knowing how to use Rails?

It‚Äôs not about Rails being ‚Äòeasy‚Äô. It‚Äôs about how Rails works. For me, the hardest part about Rails is how it does everything for me. I wrote a [blog post][10] where I do FizzBuzz in Java as a contrast to using Rails. People call it the _magic of rails_, where generating controllers or models are as easy as a command in the terminal. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Honorable mention: Rails&#39; magic seriously tripped me up! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CodeNewbie?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CodeNewbie</a></p>&mdash; Ali Spittel üíÅ (@ASpittel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ASpittel/status/1055269313177964544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">25 October 2018</a></blockquote>

It is the uncomfortable sensation of wondering *Am I using this right? Do I need to know more than this?* It‚Äôs the unfamiliarity of programming that leads me to bring up my first piece of evidence as a fluent programmer.

## I am comfortable with being uncomfortable
When we were building Facebook, there were times I just wondered to myself, *why, why does it work?* A good example is when dealing with Controllers and views. By just naming a method `index` in your Page Controller will point to your `index.html.erb`. You don‚Äôt tell Rails to do that; *it knows.* It reads your mind and sees your intent. Rails knows you better than you know yourself. **Magic**.  ü§î 

So there are times during our project where I decided to explore these ‚Äúmagical‚Äù parts of Rails. On reflection, I wondered about how much research one should do in order to understand these things. The fact that Rails allows us to quickly build an MVC application is remarkable, and I don't want to recreate Rails. 

At the end of the first week, a teammate brought up ‚Äúbeing comfortable with the unknown‚Äù in our Retro. I think that‚Äôs a good thing to think about when working on a project where you may not be familiar with the tech. Although I want to improve on understanding how things work in Rails, it‚Äôs important to also understand that these features was implemented to make life easier. I don‚Äôt need to know everything about Rails, especially when time spent researching how these features work could be better spent in improving our application. 

It‚Äôs all about that cost-benefit analysis in regards to time. That balance in programming.

##  Balance in Fluency
When I think about being fluent in any language (not just programming), I think about being able to have a conversation with someone in that language. I wouldn‚Äôt say knowing the language perfectly is the prime definition of being fluent. I‚Äôm sure there are people (like me) who can speak fluent Russian but can‚Äôt write it. I‚Äôm sure people (like me) can understand the context when someone speaks in Portuguese, but doesn‚Äôt know the language. In these cases, I don‚Äôt know the language perfectly, but I know aspects of it. What I‚Äôd probably do is **talk to someone** in the language to improve; **keep learning** the language; **practice** in that language. 

If I can do those three things, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm developing fluently. Or at least developing the skills towards fluency. You can guess what I‚Äôm doing here.

### Talking to Somebody
I think to develop your fluency in programming involves discussion. Whether you‚Äôre talking to your partner what you‚Äôve learned whilst avoiding technobabble. Or you‚Äôre curious about a new framework so you open a discussion online. Just talking about programming (or writing blogs about it üôÉ) will improve your fluency. With our Facebook, we had daily discussions regarding our program and programming in general. When one of us shared knowledge on API requests, we all benefited and grew a bit more fluent. When we talked about the pitfalls to scaffolds in Rails, things about the framework grew a bit more clearly. 

### Keep Learning
Expected. I could potentially learn Portuguese if I keep having conversations but if I‚Äôm not actively learning, then there might be principles I miss, rules of the language that I won‚Äôt pick up. Programming is so, so accessible, and it‚Äôs growing bigger every day. Thousands of blogs a day, all wanting to help out new programmers. When working on Facebook, we constantly browsed tutorials on how to implement React into Rails. How to set up our database on AWS. Even wondered how to change font on the screen without reloading the page! Not one member of our group can say they didn‚Äôt learn anything. We researched constantly and even had morning sessions where we researched independently and then share what we‚Äôve learned with the rest of the group during lunch time. 

### Practice++
Cheesy. It‚Äôs probably not helpful when you ask someone how to improve in something, and they tell you to keep practicing; but it‚Äôs so important! Whether you‚Äôre doing [100 Days of Code][11] or you‚Äôre taking what you‚Äôve learned in a tutorial and applying it to a small project, it‚Äôs practice. And you know what they say about practice?

Whenever we implemented a feature into our Facebook app I didn‚Äôt fully understand, I would spend some time on my own to research the feature and rebuild it myself. Some examples were understanding Fetch and how to make API requests or when I wanted to try building a live chat again with ActionCable and Redis - [link][12].

## Am I a Fluent Programmer?
These three components to finding balance in fluency can be applied to anything, not just programming. I guess they‚Äôre kind of like a mantra. You keep repeating them, and acting on them, then I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre a fluent programmer. Speaking of which, *can I program fluently?* I would definitely say I‚Äôm on the right path, and building a Facebook clone in just two weeks has definitely improved my programming fluency. Therefore if I was asked in an interview, I‚Äôd say yes. Not because I am, full-stop, but because I am constantly growing as a programmer and I understand that no one can be 100% fluent in programming.

As mentioned in my previous post, it‚Äôs tech-week! At the time of writing this post, I have completed my first tech-test which was to create a banking system in the console. We could do it in Ruby or JavaScript but I decided to challenge myself even further and do it in Java! It proved to be way more challenging than I expected but I was able to complete the tech-test with goals that I felt were accomplished. There will be a blog post about it soon!

Meanwhile, this is part two of a three part series. Fancy. Part three will focus on my third, and final goal. Justifying the way I work. I hope to go deeper into our application and justify the code we‚Äôve written as well as explain the decisions we‚Äôve made to get the code to where it is currently. If you want to check out our Facebook clone, [visit this link][13]. The repo for the project can be found on my GitHub [here][14]. 

This is a ‚ÄòNaNoWriMo‚Äô post. [National Novel Writing Month][15] is a yearly event where brilliant people decide to make November even tougher and decide to write 50,000 words. Usually it‚Äôs for a novel but they have a system in place for *rebels*, writers who decide not to write a novel. This is a part of that! Check out my [progress and buddy up with me][16] if you‚Äôre joining in on the fun!
