Before becoming a software developer, I was a freelance scriptwriter writing short films and television pilots. However, I always had a passion for technology and an interest developing applications that benefit humanity. Whether it's for the web, on your mobile phone, or within augmented reality, I love to challenge myself and learn new, amazing things.

I'm a coach at [codebar][18], where I help underrepresented people learn programming every Wednesday. I'm also a floater (mentor assistant) at [codeyourfuture][19], where I help out mentors teach and support refugees with the dream of becoming developers. 

Whilst I now write a different form of scripts, I still love to write. Therefore, I started a blog called the [Mental Codeathon][1], where I write technical blogs. Whether it's how I deal under pressure in a team environment or learning how to TDD in Java, I am always eager to give back to the community and share my experience.

Currently, I am working towards learning Python, C#, and Machine Learning, as well as develop an augmented reality experience for those who struggle with mental health (specifically anxiety and depression).

## Skills

### Ruby

Whether it was developing software for the terminal, or learning full-stack development with Rails and Sinatra, I was able to master Ruby during my time at Makers. 

I loved learning the concepts of Ruby, and understanding how to use the language to my advantage. Whenever I struggled on a concept (like [Modules and Mixins][15]), I'd register it as an area of improvement and work on it.

Learning Ruby wasn't only about learning a language; I used Ruby to also learn Code Design Principles, how to Test Drive, and how to debug applications.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a language that excites me due to its versatility. I knew that JS is popular in both back-end and front-end. As someone who wants to work full-stack, I knew I had to master JavaScript first, rather than jump straight into a framework. 

So I re-learned OOP with JavaScript, creating applications for the web. I even created my own testing framework in JavaScript which I proudly called [Barracuda][16].

After I felt comfortable with Vanilla JS, I begun learning frameworks like Vue, React, and React Native.

React Native was used in my final Project at Makers, where we also use APIs and Firebase to create an accessible navigation app; a demo video can be found [here][4].

### Java

Learning dynamic languages like Ruby and JavaScript was great, but I wanted some experience writing in static languages. I started with TDDing FizzBuzz in Java and I explain my process in this [blog post][17]. 

I enjoyed Java so much that I also used it in a technical test, where we had to create a banking system written for the terminal. This was an opportunity for me to practice refactoring as well as writing code that is easy to change. 

I was able to have separation of concerns in my classes, and successfully complete the tech test. A demo of the application can be found [here][8].

### DevOps/CI/CD

I also wanted to focus on automation and making my life easier. I spent some time understanding Continuous Deployment using services like Travis CI and Grunt, that can help automate my process when deploying my applications.

I am also currently learning how to use Docker and Kubernetes, something I am interested in and excited to work with.
