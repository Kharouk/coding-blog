Welcome to my blog website! I am currently studying at [Makers](https://www.makers.tech) to become a professional developer. This is a place where I go to ramble about my learnings. 

My aspirations include helping others. Either by teaching or contributing to a cause, I look forward to using my newly found skills to make the world a better place.

I used to study English Literature. So I guess I like to write. :writing_hand:
