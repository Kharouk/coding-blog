Welcome to my blog website! I am currently applying for bootcamps all around London, UK and I've noticed a common trait. Most of them teach Ruby, and many of the alumni had a blog about learning to code. Those who stuck with their blog, frequently updating and pouring out their process of learning, seemed to be most succesful in finding a job. 

Now I know what you're thinking. Just another beginner who is hoping to become a guest on a popular coding podcast with a thick blog under their belt. But I promise you, that's only partly true.


Me being an English major - with a specialty degree in writing -  I thought, well hey, let's combine an old passion with my new love for coding. So I've joined the herd. 

Thanks for sticking around.
