<div style="float:left;width:430px;">
Welcome to my blog website! I recently graduated from <a src="https://www.makers.tech">Makers</a> and became a professional software developer. 

<br><br>
My aspirations include helping others. Either by teaching or contributing to a cause, I look forward to using my newly found skills to make the world a better place. 
<br><br>
I used to study English Literature. So I guess I like to write!
